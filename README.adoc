= EQ-SQL: EWEWS Queues: SQL implementation

This repo supports EMEWS workflows in which the work to be done is
queried from and the results reported to a SQL database.

== Overview

The repo contains the following folders:

* `attic` - old pre python package now-obsolete code etc.
* `db` - code for setting up the database, manually querying and resettting it. This code is
not necessary during runtime of an EQ-SQL workflow, but is useful for creating the database
and working with it manually.
* `python` - contains the eqsql python package, and unit tests of that in the
`test` directory.
* `R`- contains the R package for EQ-SQL.
* `swift-t` - contains the swift-t EQ-SQL extension.
* `templates/swift` - examples of swift-t EQ-SQL worker pools.
* `templates/python` - examples of Python EQ-SQL worker pools.
* `tests` - tests of the R, Python, and swift-t EQ-SQL API running separately and in concert.

See the READMEs in these folders (where applicable) for more information.
