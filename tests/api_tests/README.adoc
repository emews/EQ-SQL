= Tests

ME::
The Model Explorer

WF::
The workflow worker.

NOTE: Remember to run db-reset after any failed tests!
      Otherwise, old messages will be in the queue.
      check-queues.sh checks for this automatically now.


== DB Settings
The database host etc. settings are defined in db_env.sh. 
Change this as necessary.

== Python

Pure Python tests have been moved to `EQ-SQL/python/test`

== R

R API uses the Python API via reticulate. Unit tests for
R wrapper functions are in `EQ-SQL/R/EQ.SQL/tests`

== Swift

The swift tests test a worker pool (`worker_pool.swift`) written in swift-t
using a Python or R ME. Run with:

test-swift-py-2.sh - deap GA ME with batch synchronous tasks, single DB row with multiple tasks separated
    by swift.
test-swift-py-3.sh - asynchronous ME, one task per DB row, worker pool queries up to batch size to
    execute.

== Proxy Tests

Consists of the 3 parts:

1. The deap ME (algorithm.py) which creates proxies for the function called by the worker pool,
an example proxied argument to that function, and the list of parameters.
2. The function that is proxied. This is decorated with @proxy.app which will unpack the proxied arguments
    to the function. Each proxied argument has a name, and that name must match the name of the argument to 
    the function. The final function arguments are the parameters. So for example,

    ----
    func = proxies.dump_proxies(f=test_proxy_wf.task_func)['f']
    proxy_map = proxies.dump_proxies(c=1.0)
    params = pop_to_dict(pop, ('x', 'y'))
    ...
    @proxies.app
    def task_func(c, x, y):
        ...
    ----

    Here `c` is the proxied argument corresponding to the `c` task_func argument,
    followed by the `x` and `y` parameters.

3. A worker pool that can handle proxies.

test-proxy.sh::
Launches the proxy example workflow.

test-proxy-me.py::
Launches the deap ME (algorithm.py)

test_proxy_wf.py::
Contains the proxy.app decorated function.

algorithm.py::
The deap ME that will send proxy tasks to the DB when its `use_proxy`
argument is true.

worker_pool_proxies.swift::
The worker pool for handling proxied functions and arguments.
