= Tests

ME::
The Model Explorer

WF::
The workflow worker.

NOTE: Remember to run db-reset after any failed tests!
      Otherwise, old messages will be in the queue.
      check-queues.sh checks for this automatically now.

Run these tests in the order given below.

== Plain Python

test-py-1.sh::
Simple one-way handoff of parameters from a Python ME to a Python WF

test-py-2.sh::
Simple two-way exchange of parameters between a Python ME and a Python WF

== Plain R

test-R-1.sh::
Simple one-way handoff of parameters from a R ME to a R WF

== Swift

test-swift-1.sh::
Simple test to connect to DB

=== Python ME

test-swift-2.sh::
Real DEAP run with loopj.swift

=== R ME

test-swift-3.sh::
Workflow with loop.swift with fake R ME; comma-separated messages

test-swift-4.sh::
Workflow with loopj.swift with fake R ME; JSON messages

=== Worker pools

pools-1.sh::
Chain of workflow with multiple pools

== Proxy

Consists of the 3 parts:

1. The deap ME (python/algorithm.py) which creates proxies for the function called by the worker pool,
an example proxied argument to that function, and the list of parameters.
2. The function that is proxied. This is decorated with @proxy.app which will unpack the proxied arguments
to the function. Each proxied argument has a name, and that name must match the name of the argument to 
the function. The final function arguments are the parameters. So for example,

----
func = proxies.dump_proxies(f=test_proxy_wf.task_func)['f']
proxy_map = proxies.dump_proxies(c=1.0)
params = pop_to_dict(pop, ('x', 'y'))
...
@proxies.app
def task_func(c, x, y):
    ...
----

Here `c` is the proxied argument corresponding to the `c` task_func argument,
followed by the `x` and `y` parameters.

3. A worker pool that can handle proxies.

test-proxy.sh::
Launches the proxy example workflow.

test-proxy-me.py::
Launches the deap ME (python/algorithm.py)

test_proxy_wf.py::
Contains the proxy.app decorated function.

python/algorithm.py::
The deap ME that will send proxy tasks to the DB when its `use_proxy`
argument is true.

swift/proxy_pool.swift::
The worker pool for handling proxied functions and arguments.
